         - Use Locale::TextDomain::UTF8.

         - No functional changes. Use a single Locale::TextDomain textdomain for
           the distribution.


0.38     2013-12-12 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release. Merged several distributions into one
           (Perinci-Sub-To-Text, Perinci-To-Text, Perinci-Sub-To-POD,
           Perinci-To-POD) because they are closely related to one another and
           used to break each other when put as separate dists.

         - Switch from Locale::Maketext to Locale::TextDomain.
