0.46     2014-03-21 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix bug in package POD generation (missing blank line between

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Translation of result description in POD.


0.43     2014-03-21 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Remove POD references to old scripts.


0.42     2014-01-22 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Function argument's summary/description were using function's
           summary/description due to wrong variable used.

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove deprecated scripts 'peri-func-doc' and 'peri-pkg-doc'.


0.41     2013-12-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Mark 'peri-func-doc' and 'peri-pkg-doc' as
           deprecated in favor of 'peri-doc'. I was lazy back then and created
           two separate commands for my convenience, but it was convenient for
           users to have a single command.


0.40     2013-12-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Use Locale::TextDomain::UTF8.


0.39     2013-12-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Use a single Locale::TextDomain textdomain for
           the distribution.


0.38     2013-12-12 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release. Merged several distributions into one
           (Perinci-Sub-To-Text, Perinci-To-Text, Perinci-Sub-To-POD,
           Perinci-To-POD) because they are closely related to one another and
           used to break each other when put as separate dists.

         - Switch from Locale::Maketext to Locale::TextDomain.
